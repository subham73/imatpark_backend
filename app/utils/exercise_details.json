A disadvantage compared to the barbell squat is that it is difficult to use very heavy weights in this exercise, which means that you eventually might have difficulties increasing the load."

That can make this exercise suitable for beginners, children och the elderly, for example. A disadvantage compared to the barbell deadlift is that it is difficult to use very heavy weights in this exercise, which means that you eventually might have difficulties increasing the load."

If you want to train your quads (front of the thigh) with a kettlebell, then goblet squats or front squats are a better alternative."
